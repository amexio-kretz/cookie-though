        to the grounds for processing as listed in the European General Data Protection Regulation
        (GDPR). Hereunder we clarify on which legal grounds we process your data depending on your

        consent in writing (by email or letter).
      </p>
      <p>
        When we process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we will limit the effects
        that this may have on your privacy by minimising our use and establishing appropriate access
        and security safeguards in order to prevent unauthorised use. Moreover, you have at any time
        the right to object against the processing of your data that is based on our legitimate interests.

      <p>
        We may process other data, such as data of essential cookies and functional cookies. The use of

      <h3>4. From whom do we receive your data?</h3>

      <p>
        We mainly store your data on externally hosted IT systems. We partly outsource the storageof your data
        to specialised third parties. These external service providers act as “processors” on our behalf
        (see title 7).
      </p>
      <p>
        We and our processors have taken the necessary physical and appropriate technical and organisational
        (precautionary) measures in order to secure your personal data against any form of unlawful processing.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>7.  Which data do we transfer to third parties or third countries?</h3>
      <p>
        We will not share your data with third parties (except our processors) for commercial reasons without
        your consent. Furthermore will can share your data with third parties if when we are required to do so
        by law, if this is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or when this is necessary
        for providing you with our products and services as a digital products studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned under title 6, we have engaged external service providers, so-called “processors”, to
        support our business operations. These external service providers perform certain processing activities
        on your data on our behalf. We will only share your data with these external service providers insofar
        this is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.  These “processors” cannot use your data
        for any other purposes. In addition, they are contractually bound to ensure the confidentiality of your
        data. To guarantee the aforementioned commitments, we have concluded so-called “data processing agreements”
        with these parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your data might be processed outside the EEA. Your data will only be transferred to third parties located
        in countries outside of the EEA of which the European Commission has decided that they ensure an adequate

      <h3>8.  What are your rights as a data subject?</h3>
      <p>
        At any time you can manage your data that was collected by In The Pocket, by exercising your rights as a data subject.
      </p>
      <p>You have the following rights:</p>
      <p><strong>Right of access and copy</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to access your data and to obtain a copy of it. </p>
      <p><strong>Right to rectification</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to obtain rectification of inaccurate data that concerns you. </p>
      <p><strong>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to request that we erase your data without unreasonable delay.</p>
      <p><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong></p>
      <p>
        You have the right to restrict the processing of your data. In this case the processing
        will be temporarily ceased until there is, for example, certainty about the correctness
        of the data.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Right to object</strong></p>
      <p>
        You have the right to object against the processing of your data that is based on our
        legitimate interests. You can exercise this right on grounds relating to your particular
        situation. In this case we need to cease the processing, unless we can demonstrate compelling
        legitimate grounds to continue processing your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can, regardless of the legal basis upon which the processing is based, always object
        against the use of your data for direct marketing, after which we are obliged to stop
        processing for these purposes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Right to data portability</strong></p>
      <p>
        You have the right to receive the data, which you provided to us, in a structured,
        commonly used and machine-readable format. This makes it easy for you to transfer
        your data to another organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have the right to request us to directly transfer your data to another organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the exercise of the above rights is subject to certain limitations,
        as provided in the GDPR and further specified in other applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>9. How can you exercise your rights?</h3>
      <p>
        If you would like to exercise one of the rights described above, please contact us
        via the contact details provided under title 1 and repeated under title 9 (by mail, email or telephone).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you submit a request to exercise your rights, we will first of all verify your
        identity by requesting a copy of your identity card. We do so in order to prevent your
        data from falling into the wrong hands. In this event we ask you to cross out the irrelevant
        information on your identity card, such as your citizen number and photo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exercising your rights is in principle free of charge. If your request appears to be manifestly
        unfounded or excessive (in particular because of its repetitive character), we may charge you a
        reasonable fee in order to cover our own administrative costs. In such cases, however, we may also
        simply refuse to act on your request. You will then be notified of the reasons for this refusal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each case, we will notify you within a period of 4 weeks (for simple requests), or 3 months
        (for complex or frequent requests) of the response to your request.
      </p>
