# Cookie Though

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

## NodeJS

Best to install NodeJS via asdf (not supported for Windows). This allows you to easily switch to a new Node version, if it is released.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.0
# Add the following line to ~/.bash_profile
. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh
```

Add nodejs plugin

```sh
# Dependencies on gpg and GNU core utils
brew install coreutils gpg
asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.
bash -c '${ASDF_DATA_DIR:=$HOME/.asdf}/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring'
```

Once asdf & nodejs plugin are installed, you can just run:

```sh
asdf install
npm install
```

## Testing

Test are run with jest. Plugin can be installed for vscode [vscode-jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest). This allows you to easily run/debug tests from within vscode. Tests can also be executed via npm:
